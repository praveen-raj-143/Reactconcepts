        <h2>Virtual DOM</h2>
        <p>The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of Real DOM. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM. It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called reconciliation. (or) DOM is a document object model, created by converting HTML CSS and JS Real DOM, which is an object which gets created whenever any React application gets loaded on the screen for the first time., whenever React components gets mounted on the screen for the first time. Now when any user makes any changes on the screen like button click because of which the state variable will get updated so in this case the changes will not directly go to Real DOM , instead in react we have concept known Virtual DOM. So we are having two virtual doms, one virtual dom gets created at the time of mounting of react component so it is a copy of your real dom. Another virtual dom is the dom which contains the new changes, updated state variables values. Now these two virtual doms will get compared with each other and will check for the new changes. this complete procedure is known as diffing algorithm. Now the new changes will be updated in your Real dom. this procedure is known as Recoinciliation.</p>
        <h2>SPA</h2>
        <p>Single page application : Any web application , in which when you are clicking on any button or selecting option from navigation bar then if your page which means browser page is reloading then that means that application is your multi - page application . If it does not reload the browser page and just only updates the page without reloading then that application is known as Single Page application. When you create React application using CRA, (create-react-app boilerplate , developed by Facebook) it always create the application which will be Single page application.</p>
        <h2>JSX</h2>
        <p>JSX is a XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript (the acronym stands for JavaScript XML). Basically it just provides syntactic sugar for the React.createElement() function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax. In the example below text inside</p>
        <p>JSX or JavaScript XML combines HTML and JavaScript, making the code easier to read and understandable for the user. JSX combines interactivity with markup rather than separating the two. It makes it easier to visualize DOM. In JSX we can directly write HTML tags inside JavaScript code. One of the advantages of JSX is that React creates a virtual DOM (a virtual representation of the page) to track changes and updates. Instead of rewriting the entire HTML, React modifies the DOM of the page whenever the information is updated. This is one of the main issues React was created to solve.</p>
        <h2>SEO </h2>
        <p>Search engine optimisation (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic (known as “natural” or “organic” results) rather than direct traffic or paid traffic. React helps build a very user-friendly UI that is also valuable by SEO, so you definitely shouldn't avoid it while creating a user interface for your app/website. However, you should use some tricks to ensure that your React-site is understandable for Google crawlers and, therefore, good for SEO.</p>
        <h2>HOOK's</h2>
        <p>Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.</p>
        <p>Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods.</p>
